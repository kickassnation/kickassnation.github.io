Mobility Service Research Lab aims to develop and innovate the next-generation
mobility service and platform. Current focuses of our lab include, but not
limited to, future interfaces, robotic systems, software architectures, and hardware
devices in mobility services under various environments, including virtual
spaces. Our research scope also covers socio-economic/political items in
mobility services, such as ESG, NFT, government policy, and standardization.\\
